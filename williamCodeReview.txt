The code appears to be in good shape syntactically. While the comments offer insight into the code's functionality, adding more detail could significantly improve clarity. I can see the authors efforts to minimize repetitive code which is commendable. No software defects were found, the program executed consistent and efficient functionality. Although the exception handling covers the basics, there may be room to strengthen it further, particularly for specific database-related issues. The authors approach was very efficient, using a group box for individually, searching, sorting, filtering, and updating.
My approach was less concise, but this authors approach was far more efficient in my opinion. Suggestions for improvement include enhancing comments for clarity and enhancing error handling and input validation.  Overall, the developer prodced a very well written and executable program.
